// !brokered.address.topic.longDescription:start
The topic address type supports the publish-subscribe messaging pattern where there are 1..N
publishers and 1..M subscribers. Each message published to a topic address is forwarded to all
subscribers for that address. This address type is appropriate for implementing a notification mechanism where you
need multiple subscribers to get the same events. A subscriber can also be durable, in which case
messages are kept until the subscriber has acknowledged them.
