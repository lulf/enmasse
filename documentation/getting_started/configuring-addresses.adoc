= Configuring Addresses

{ProductName} is configured with a set of addresses that you can use for
messages. Currently, {ProductName} supports 4 different address types for the `standard` address space:

* Brokered queues
* Brokered topics (pub/sub)
* Direct anycast addresses
* Direct broadcast addresses

See the <<address_model>> for details.  {ProductName} also comes with a console that you can use for managing addresses.

{ProductName} supports managing addresses natively in {PlatformName}.
