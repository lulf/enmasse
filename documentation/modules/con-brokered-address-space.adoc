= Brokered address space

The brokered address space is designed to support broker-specific features, at the cost of limited
scale in terms of the number of connections and addresses. This address space supports JMS
transactions, message groups, and so on.

Clients connect to and send and receive messages in this address space using the AMQP, CORE, OPENWIRE and MQTT  protocols.
